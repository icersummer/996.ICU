- "996" work system, that is, 9 am every day, work until 9 o'clock in the evening. Work 6 days a week.

The eight-hour work system that the world's proletarian ancestors exchanged with countless blood and sacrifices cannot be so ruined in our hands. Even if it is defeated by capital, we must bite it before that.
